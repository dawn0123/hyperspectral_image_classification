# Classification-of-Hyperspectral-Image
Classification of the Hyperspectral Image Indian Pines with Convolutional Neural Network

Hyperspectral images are images captured in multiple bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. This project is focussed at the development of Deep Learned Artificial Neural Networks for robust landcover classification in hyperspectral images. Land-cover classification is the task of assigning to every pixel, a class label that represents the type of land-cover present in the location of the pixel. It is an image segmentation/scene labeling task. The following diagram describes the task.
